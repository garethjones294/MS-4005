# Format, sort, filter, and highlight data using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel

With Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel, it's easy to highlight, sort, and filter your tables to quickly call attention to what matters to you. Using a single table in Excel, you can have Copilot effortlessly:

- Sort and filter your data.

- Apply simple conditional formatting.

To get started, format your data in a [supported format](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/format-data-for-copilot-in-excel-1604c8eb-57f1-4db1-8363-d53336228c65) and select the **Copilot** button in the ribbon. Then, tell Copilot how you'd like to manipulate the table to better view portions of your data.

In the following example, we start with a simple prompt and add elements along the way. Follow along with the example using your own data.

## Let's get crafting

First, download **_[Fabrikam Q1 marketing campaigns.xlsx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269124)_** and save the file to your **OneDrive folder** if you haven't yet done so.

Open the spreadsheet in Excel and then open the **Copilot** pane by selecting the Copilot icon in the ribbon's **Home** tab. Enter the prompts below and follow along.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Sort this table._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to sort and filter an Excel table_. However, there's no indication how you want the data sorted and which field you want to filter.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **_Sort this table..._** |
| **Good prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand what the slides are for and what topic to focus on. _"...to look for the most impactful salesperson."_ |
| **Better prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | The **Source** for this prompt is assumed to be the table we're working with in Excel. _"...this table [Table1]..."_ |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how you want the table sorted, filtered, and presented. _"and highlight the top and bottom campaign owners based off of net revenue."_ |

> [!NOTE]
> **Crafted prompt**:
>
> _Sort this table [Table1] to look for the most impactful salesperson and highlight the top and bottom campaign owners based off of net revenue_

This prompt requires multiple steps to execute, a prompting technique called **chaining** where you ask Copilot to perform sequential, back-to-back commands to achieve a single goal.

**First prompt**:

```text
Sort this table [Table1] to look for the most impactful salesperson.
```

**Second Prompt**:

```text
highlight the top and bottom campaign owners based off of net revenue
```

Copilot has all the info it needs to give you a solid answer, thanks to the **Goal**, **Context**, **Source**, and **Expectations** in this prompt.
