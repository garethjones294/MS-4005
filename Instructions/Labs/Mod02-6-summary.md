# Summary

In this module, you have learnt how to use Copilot in various Microsoft applications such as Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 Chat. In Word, you can open the Copilot pane through the ribbon's Home tab or start writing directly in the document to generate new content. In PowerPoint, Copilot assists in creating, designing, and formatting slides by typing in your presentation's content. In Outlook, Copilot helps with inbox management and email writing by quickly drafting emails and summarizing long email threads. Lastly, Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat integrates with your work data and apps to enhance creativity, productivity, and skill development.

The main takeaways from this module are:

1. Copilot is an AI-powered tool that assists in generating content, creating presentations, drafting emails, and achieving broader goals and objectives.

1. To effectively use Copilot, provide clear prompts with a **Goal**, **Context**, **Source(s)**, and **Expectations** to get the desired results.

1. Copilot can reference up to three files to base your new document or presentation on, but make sure you have permission to access these files or Copilot won't be able to access them either.
