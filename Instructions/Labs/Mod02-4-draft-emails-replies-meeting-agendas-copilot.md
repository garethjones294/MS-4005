# Draft emails, replies, and meeting agendas with Microsoft 365 Copilot in Outlook

Copilot in Outlook makes inbox management easier with AI-powered assistance to help you write emails quickly and turn long email threads into short summaries. It combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with Outlook data to help you stay productive in the workplace.

## Let's get crafting

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Draft a new email._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to draft a new email._ However, there's no information about what the email will even be about, who to send it to, or what you want it to sound like.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **_Draft a new email._** |
| **Good prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand what the email should be about and who the audience is. _"...to my client, Allan Deyoung, regarding the status of their support ticket."_ |
| **Better prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | Adding **Sources** can help Copilot know where to look for specific information. _"Refer to the latest update from my notes: The issue has been escalated to Tier 2 support, and a resolution is expected within 48 hours."_ |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how you want the document to be written and formatted. _"The email should sound professional and technical, but written with empathy."_ |
