## Let's get crafting

First, download **_[Fabrikam Q1 marketing campaigns.xlsx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269124)_** and save the file to your **OneDrive folder** if you haven't yet done so.

Open the spreadsheet in Excel and then open the **Copilot** pane by selecting the Copilot icon in the ribbon's **Home** tab. Enter the prompts below and follow along.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Suggest a formula column._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to create a new column with a formula_. However, there isn’t enough detail to determine what the formula should calculate.  

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **_Suggest a formula column._** |
| **Good prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** helps Copilot understand what the formula should calculate. _"...for column J to determine the engagement ratio of each campaign."_ |
| **Better prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | The **Source** for this prompt is the specific columns needed for the calculation. _"...using the values from 'Engaged Users' and 'Total Users Targeted'."_ |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Adding **Expectations** helps Copilot structure the formula correctly. _"Ensure the formula divides 'Engaged Users' by 'Total Users Targeted' and formats the result as a percentage."_ |

> [!NOTE]  
> **Crafted prompt:**  
>
> _Suggest a formula for column J to calculate the engagement ratio of each campaign. Use the values from 'Engaged Users' and 'Total Users Targeted'. Ensure the formula divides 'Engaged Users' by 'Total Users Targeted' and formats the result as a percentage._
