# Highlight key decisions and actions from Teams meetings

Copilot in Microsoft Teams enhances collaboration and helps you get the most out of your Teams chats and meetings. Quickly recap, identify follow-up tasks, create agendas, and ask questions for more effective and focused meetings. Summarize key takeaways, see what was missed, and pinpoint key people of interest in chat threads you were added to. All without breaking the flow of discussion. Copilot is available in the following meetings and calls:

- One-on-one and group calls

- Single meetings or scheduled private meetings

- Instances or occurrences of meetings in a series

- Channel meetings

- Meet Now

Copilot in Teams uses your Teams chat and meeting content to generate insights and actionable suggestions alongside your most important Teams touch points. Copilot in Teams is contextual to whatever it is that you're doing. For example, you can access the Copilot pane in a chat, meeting, or call, as long as a few conditions are met:

- Transcription or recording is turned on. The meeting organizer can configure the meeting so Copilot works without transcription prior to the meeting.

- The meeting or call is long enough for Copilot to analyze. If there isn’t enough transcribed speech in the meeting yet, Copilot states that it needs more information before responding to prompts.

During a meeting or call, select **Copilot** from the meeting controls. If transcription isn’t already turned on, you'll be asked to turn it on.

Copilot appears in a panel on the right side of the meeting window. Once the meeting is over, select the meeting in your **Teams Calendar**. From there, select the **Recap** tab in your meeting details. You can also access the Copilot panel from the meeting recap to ask questions about the meeting.

## Let's get crafting

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Recap this Teams meeting._

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to recap a Teams meeting._ However, there's no information about why the meeting needs to be summarized or what the summary is needed for.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **Recap this Teams meeting.** |
| **Good prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand the purpose and adjust the response accordingly. _"I was late to attend and need a brief overview of the project timeline."_ |
| **Better prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | Adding **Sources** can help Copilot understand which part needs to be summarized and provide a more accurate response. _"Did Adele Vance propose any changes?"_ |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how to format the summary and what level of detail is required. _"Include the project timeline in a table and any proposed changes from Adele."_ |

> [!NOTE]
> **Crafted prompt**:
>
> _Recap this Teams meeting. I was late to attend and need a brief overview of the project timeline. Did Adele Vance propose any changes? Include the project timeline in a table and any proposed changes from Adele._

In this prompt, the **Goal**, **Context**, **Source**, and **Expectations** are all provided, giving Copilot enough direction to generate a response that meets your needs.
