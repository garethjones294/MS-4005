In addition to creating content or generating ideas, Copilot in Word has the ability to answer questions about the document you're reading. Once Copilot responds to your prompt, you can also view references with citations from where Copilot pulled information in your document.

## Ask questions about this document

- Summarize this document - Need to get to the essence of the document quickly? Type Summarize this document into the Copilot chat pane to get a bulleted summary of the document.

- Is there a call to action? - Wondering if the document contains a meaningful call to action? Ask Copilot, and it will attempt to tell you.

## Ask open-ended questions

Want to add some content or context to your document? Ask Copilot general questions, and it will try to give you answers. For example:

- How can I edit this document to make it sound more academic?

- Is there a quote by a United States President about courage?

If those answers aren't in the document, Copilot generates content using the underlying large language models. If you find something you like and want to add it to the document, just copy and paste from the Copilot pane to the document.

## Let's get crafting

First, download **_[Market Analysis Report for Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268826)_** and save the file to your **OneDrive folder** if you haven't yet done so.

Open the document in Word and then open the **Copilot** pane by selecting the Copilot icon in the ribbon's **Home** tab. Enter the prompts below and follow along.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _Is there a call to action?_

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to find a meaningful call to action in the document._ However, you still haven't explained _why_ you need this information.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **_Is there a call to action?_** |
| **Good prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | Adding **Sources** can help Copilot where to look for specific information. _"...in this market analysis report..."_ |
| **Better prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot respond with context and give you a more tailored response. _"...to address our challenges and concerns. Please check if the marketing plan includes a clear and specific plan of action, such as a promotional plan or a limited time discount."_ |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand what exactly you need, instead of just giving you a flat _yes_ or _no_ answer. _"Please provide suggestions for improving the call to action if necessary."_ |
