# Ask about your meetings and messages with Microsoft 365 Copilot in Teams

Copilot in Teams meetings and calls helps you capture action items, different perspectives by topic, or unresolved questions. You can even ask Copilot to give you a response as a table, generating a markdown table that's ready for you to copy and share.

Copilot in Teams uses your Teams chat and meeting content to generate insights and actionable suggestions alongside your most important Teams touch points. Copilot in Teams is contextual to whatever it is that you're doing. For example, you can access the Copilot pane in a chat, meeting, or call, as long as a few conditions are met:

- Transcription or recording is turned on. The meeting organizer can configure the meeting so Copilot works without transcription prior to the meeting.

- The meeting or call is long enough for Copilot to analyze. If there isn’t enough transcribed speech in the meeting yet, Copilot states that it needs more information before responding to prompts.

## Access Copilot during a meeting

1. During a meeting or call, select **Copilot** from the meeting controls. If transcription isn’t already turned on, you'll be asked to turn it on.

1. Copilot appears in a panel on the right side of the meeting window. Once the meeting is over, select the meeting in your **Teams Calendar**. From there, select the **Recap** tab in your meeting details. You can also access the Copilot panel from the meeting recap to ask questions about the meeting.

## Start simple and add detail

> [!NOTE]
> Starting prompt:
>
> _What questions are unresolved in this meeting?_

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to identify any open questions that weren't resolved during the meeting_. However, there's not very much information about the request or meeting.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **What questions are unresolved in this meeting?** |
| **Good prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand the purpose and adjust the response accordingly. _"...in the client meeting regarding the new project proposal."_ |
| **Better prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | Adding **Sources** can help Copilot understand which meeting or part of the meeting needs to be searched, but in this case the **Source** is already assumed. _"in the client meeting?"_ |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand what to do with the information it has found. _"Please identify any questions or concerns that were raised but not addressed in the last meeting. Please provide suggestions for addressing these questions and concerns in the next meeting."_ |

> [!NOTE]
> **Crafted prompt**:
>
> _What questions remain unresolved in the client meeting regarding the new project proposal. Please identify any questions or concerns that were raised but not addressed in the last meeting. Please provide suggestions for addressing these questions and concerns in the next meeting._

In this prompt, the **Goal**, **Context**, **Source**, and **Expectations** are all provided, giving Copilot enough direction to generate a response that meets your needs.
